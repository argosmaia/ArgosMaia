### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Bio: 

Hello, my name is Argos! I am an undergraduate student at the State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ) and I interned on a project at Ideiaglobo at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-RJ) from July 2022 to March 2023.
I've developed experience in some programming languages, such as Java, SwiftUI and Python while on the internship.
I've developed an website using HTML, Bootstrap 5 and JS and a Game using ARKit for Swift but for confidentiality I can't show it!

Besides, I am learning others programming languages as C, C++, C#.

I am multi-task and I like to do many projects, not as a sÃªnior dev, but yet as a intern/Jr dev, trying to gain exp in many areas as possible!

As I mentioned in my bio below my profile pic, I like software development (Mobile and Desktop), Game Dev and Cybersecurity (not professional, yet a beginner).
