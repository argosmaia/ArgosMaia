### Hi there 👋

### Bio: 

<html>

  <h1>Argos's Resume</h1>
</head>
<body>
  <p>I am an undergraduate student and a interner at the State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ) and I've interned on a project at Ideiaglobo at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-RJ) from July 2022 to March 2023.</p>
  <p>During my internship, I developed experience in programming languages such as Java, SwiftUI, and Python. I also developed a website using HTML, Bootstrap 5, and JS, and a game using ARKit for Swift. I used Java and Python for the game, but due to a confidentiality contract, I am not able to show it.</p>
  <p>I am currently learning other programming languages, such as C, C++, C#, and Rust. I am also multi-tasking and I like to do many projects. I am not a senior developer, but I am an intern/junior developer who is trying to gain experience in as many areas as possible.</p>
  <p>As I mentioned in my bio below my profile pic, I like software development (mobile and desktop), game development, and cybersecurity (not professional, yet a beginner).</p>
