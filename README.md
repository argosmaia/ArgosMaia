### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Bio: 

Hello, my name is Argos! I am an undergraduate student at the State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ) and I interned on a project at Ideiaglobo at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-RJ) from July 2022 to March 2023.
<p>I've developed experience as interner in some programming languages, such as Java, SwiftUI and Python while on the internship.
<p>I've developed an website using HTML, Bootstrap 5 and JS and a Game using ARKit for Swift and have used Java and Python but because a confidentiality contract I am not able to show it!
<p>Besides, I am learning others programming languages as C, C++, C# and Rust.
<p>I am multi-task and I like to do many projects, not as a senior dev, but yet as a intern/Jr dev, trying to gain exp in many areas as possible!
<p>As I mentioned in my bio below my profile pic, I like software development (Mobile and Desktop), Game Dev and Cybersecurity (not professional, yet a beginner).
